1) As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want

2) As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember

3) As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note


read them line 1, line 3 then line 2.
